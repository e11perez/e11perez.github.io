Starter setup for Lab3: Study Buddy
# 💻 Lab 3: Bootstrap Study Buddy

Welcome to Lab 3! In this lab, you'll apply your HTML and CSS skills and begin working with **Bootstrap** to build a responsive Study Buddy web page.

## 🧠 Goal

Create a web page that showcases your ideal study buddy. You’ll include:

- A brief description
- A layout using Bootstrap grid system
- Images styled with Bootstrap classes
- A responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `index.html` — Your main HTML file to build the Study Buddy page.
- `styles.css` — A custom stylesheet to add your own styles in addition to Bootstrap.
- `images/` — A folder where you can store any images you use in your design (along with the starter design images).
- `README.md` — Instructions and project summary (you’re reading it!).
